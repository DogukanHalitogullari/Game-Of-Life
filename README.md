Run Method:
Diamond: ./game_of_life examples/diamond/diamond.txt output/diamond/out_
Almosymmetric: ./game_of_life examples/almosymmetric/almosymmetric.txt output/almosymmetric/out_
Double-barrelled: ./game_of_life examples/double-barrelled/double-barrelled.txt output/double-barrelled/out_
Glider: ./game_of_life examples/glider/glider.txt output/glider/out_
Spaceship: ./game_of_life examples/spaceship/spaceship.txt output/spaceship/out_
Squaredance: ./game_of_life examples/squaredance/squaredance.txt output/squaredance/out_

BONUS PART: 
You can check oscilator using 'Almosymetric' run code.
You can see game is oscilator or not end of game screen. 
If game is oscillator ----> This game is_oscillator. (should be printed end of game)
If game is not oscillator ----> this game is_not_oscillator. (should be printed end of game)

If you want to slow game speed, you can use sleep(1) instead of usleep(10000) in main function.
